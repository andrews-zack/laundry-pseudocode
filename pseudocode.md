**About**
<br>
- The modern task of laundry revolves around the use of a washing machine and a dryer.
<br>
- The washing machine requires water, detergent, and clothes to work as intended.
<br>
- After completion of the washing cycle, the clothes are then transferred to the dryer.
<br>
- Once the dryer finishes, the user must hang up the shirts, fold pants/shorts, and bundle socks.
